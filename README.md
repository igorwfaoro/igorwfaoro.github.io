## About Me
I'm a senior full-stack developer working across backend and frontend, with experience building scalable and reliable systems.
I've worked with technologies like Node.js, (React, Next.js, TypeScript, Angular), C#, Java and PHP to solve real-world challenges and improve performance.
Currently, I contribute to core systems at Leroy Merlin and co-founded Pristen, where we build fast, custom digital solutions, from automation tools to full platforms.
